      <h1>Movie, Book, and Album Recomendations</h1>
      <h2>Books</h2>
      <p><strong><em>Fergus Crane</em> - Paul Stewart</strong></p>
      <p>Fergus Crane was my favorite childhood story. It follows Fergus, a boy 
      living on an island who is whisked away on an exciting adventure. The book 
      features illustrations by Chris Riddell, who has an incredibly unqiue 
      style. His drawings paired with a relatively mature and engaging story 
      made this book stick in my mind as a child. Even today I remember many 
      of the illustrations and could regonize his style anywhere. This book 
      captivated me in my youth, and I would reccomend it for anyone with 
      children interested in reading.</p>

      <p><strong><em>House of Leaves</em> - Mark Z. Danielewski</strong></p>
      <p>This is the book I am currently reading, and I love it so far! The 
      story is about a young man, Johnny, who finds hundreds pages of writing 
      about a movie that never existed. The book details these pages with 
      footnotes from Johnny. As the plot of the movie becomes more supernatural, 
      the footnates become less grounded, and Johnny begins to ramble. It is an 
      incredibly engaging postmodern story, and I look forward to finishing it!</p>

      <h2>Movies</h2>

      <p><strong><em>The Princess Bride</em> (1987)</strong></p>
      <p>This was my favorite movie as a child, and remains that way today. The 
      humor is entertaining for all ages, and the actors are flawless. In addition, 
      many lines are iconic pieces of recent culture, and many people quote it 
      without even realizing. Overall, it is a great movie with undeniable impact.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Everything Everywhere All At Once</em> (2022)</strong></p>
      <p>I watched this movie over the Summer, a year after it was first released. 
      The story is simultaneously emotional and hilarious, and I had to frequently 
      hold myself back from laughing or crying too loud. In addition, it features 
      many practical effects as a result of its lower budget. Many large movie 
      studios are afraid to experiment in the same way that this movie did, and 
      I hope its success inspires more original movies.</p>

      <h2>Albums</h2>

      <p><img src="media/glasshouses.jpg" 
      alt="Billy Joel Glass Houses album cover"></p>
      <p><strong><em>Glass Houses</em> - Billy Joel (1980)</strong></p>
      <p>After listening to this album a couple years ago, I quickly fell in 
      love. Every song is great at minimum, if not perfect. They are all catchy, 
      memorable, and great for any road trip playlist. My favorite songs are 
      <em>Sleeping With the Television On</em> and <em>You May be Right</em>.</p>

      <p><img src="media/aimandignite.jpg" 
      alt="Fun Aim And Ignite album cover"></p>
      <p><strong><em>Aim and Ignite</em> - fun. (2009)</strong></p>
      <p>Like many, I discovered fun. through their second album, 
      <em>Some Nights</em>. But after listening to the rest of their music, I 
      began to prefer their first album. <em>Some Nights</em> is a great album, 
      but it is more suited to be played on a radio, losing much of the unique 
      sound featured in <em>Aim and Ignite</em>. There are some songs that I 
      would rather skip, but highlights like <em>Benson Hedges</em> and 
      <em>Light A Roman Candle With Me</em> make up for it.</p>
